# assignment-0-repo
This is the repository for the dummy individual assignment. The purpose of this assignment is for you to set up your GitHub account and join the GitHub classroom for this course. Additionally you are also expected to familiriaze with the Pair Programming tool (repl.it) that we will use for team projects.

**GitHub** is a free-to-use project management tool between multiple collaborators. Here is a step-by-step guide to how you can complete this assignment.

## Joining Github
Please go to: https://github.com and sign up for an account using your B-mail id (as in the binghamton.edu id).

## Joining repl.it
**Repl.it** is a pair programming tool that integrates very well with GitHub. It hosts IDEs for a number of languages. You will be using this for your group assignments.\
Please go to: https://repl.it and click on the **Sign Up** tab.\
The Sign Up page provides you a variety of Sign Up option each embedded through a logo: Google, GitHub and Facebook. Please click on the GitHub logo to **Sign Up using GitHub**.\
At this point you should reach this page:\

Once you sign into repl.it, please accustom yourself to the platform by trying out the Python3 IDE and writing simple codes.

## Accessing the assignment link
After setting up your GitHub and repl.it accounts, please use this link shared in the announcement to access the assignment.

### Join Classroom
Clicking on the link will prompt you to first join the Classroom as a Student. You will be taken to a page that has a list of student identifiers. Each student's identifier is set to the student's full name.\

Please select your identifier (name) from this list to join the classroom.

### Accepting the Assignment
Once you have joined the classroom, the next page prompts you to accept the assignment. This step creates a clone of the initial assignment repository customized under your GitHub account name. This cloned repository is basically your submission repository listed under this assignment.\

### Working on your assignment
The (cloned) submission repository should appear on your GitHub account. You can click on this repository and choose the option to **work on repl.it**.\
You can click on this to open the repl.it platform and continue coding on their IDE. This will be particularly useful when you collaborate as teams on future assignment.\
Once you have made the necessary changes, you can use GitHub commands to *commit* these changes to the submission repository.\
Please check the 3-step guide on how to save local repositories to remote on GitHub.\

**Please check the instructions sheets on repl.it and GitHub and familiarize yourself with these portals.**
